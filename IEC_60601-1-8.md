## Introduction

INFORMATION SIGNALS convey information that is independent of an ALARM CONDITION.

## 3.1

* ALARM CONDITION
state of the ALARM SYSTEM when it has determined that a potential or actual HAZARD exists
NOTE 1 An ALARM CONDITION can be invalid, i.e. a FALSE POSTIVE ALARM CONDITION. NOTE 2 An ALARM CONDITION can be missed, i.e. a FALSE NEGATIVE ALARM CONDITION.

## 3.23

* INFORMATION SIGNAL
any signal that is not an ALARM SIGNAL or a REMINDER SIGNAL
EXAMPLE 1 ECG waveform
EXAMPLE 2 SpO2 tone
EXAMPLE 3 Fluoroscopy beam-on indication

## 5.1 Indicator lights and controls

In addition to the requirements for colours of indicator lights and their meanings in 7.8.1 of the general standard, the requirements of 6.3.2.2 apply.

## 6.1.2 * ALARM CONDITION priority

An INFORMATION SIGNAL may also be used to indicate the potential for delayed minor injury or discomfort.

## 6.3.2.1 General

ALARM SYSTEMS shall generate visual ALARM SIGNALS to indicate the presence of ALARM CONDITIONS, their priority and each specific ALARM CONDITION.

## 6.3.2.2 * Characteristics of visual ALARM SIGNALS

If a visual indicator is necessary for the OPERATOR to identify the equipment or part of the equipment that requires OPERATOR response or awareness, at least one visual ALARM SIGNAL shall be provided that:

a) indicates the priority of the highest priority ALARM CONDITION; and
b) can be perceived correctly at a distance of 4 m from the ALARM SYSTEM.

If an alarm indicator light or graphical simulation of an indicator light is used for these purposes, it shall comply with the colour and flashing requirements given in Table 2. Alternatively, this indication may be generated by some other type of visual display or device.

ALARM SYSTEMS that do not contain HIGH PRIORITY or MEDIUM PRIORITY ALARM CONDITIONS are exempt from this requirement if their visual indication cannot be confused with a HIGH PRIORITY or MEDIUM PRIORITY alarm indicator light complying with Table 2.

_NOTE 1 This visual indicator is necessary for ALARM SYSTEMS that are intended to be located in the proximity of other ALARM SYSTEMS._

_NOTE 2 This visual indicator is not necessary for ALARM SYSTEMS that are worn, e.g., a paging receiver. NOTE 3 An indicator light can be simulated, e.g. by a graphical display._

## Definition 3.1 – ALARM CONDITION

On this basis, the committee defined ALARM CONDITION as: “state of the ALARM SYSTEM when it has determined that a potential or actual HAZARD exists

## Definition 3.23 – INFORMATION SIGNAL

ALARM SIGNALS are only generated because of the presence of ALARM CONDITIONS. In contrast, INFORMATION SIGNALS are those which are generated regardless of whether or not an ALARM CONDITION is present, e.g. the tone of the pulse oximeter, the tone of the electrocardiograph, the waveform of the electrocardiograph, the heart rate numeric. INFORMATION SIGNALS are independent of ALARM CONDITIONS, although INFORMATION SIGNALS can frequently convey information that is “alarming” to the OPERATOR.

_EXAMPLE 1 The decreasing tonal frequency of the auditory INFORMATION SIGNAL of some pulse oximeters. The decreased tone is “alarming” to the OPERATOR, but in itself is not an ALARM SIGNAL._

_EXAMPLE 2 An electrocardiograph waveform indicating ventricular fibrillation. EXAMPLE 3 A heart rate of 20 beats per minute._


# IEC 60601-1-8-A1

## 3.1

* ALARM CONDITION

state of the ALARM SYSTEM when it has determined that a potential or actual HAZARDOUS SITUATION exists for which OPERATOR awareness or response is required

_NOTE 1 An ALARM CONDITION can be invalid, i.e. a FALSE POSITIVE ALARM CONDITION._

_NOTE 2 An ALARM CONDITION can be missed, i.e. a FALSE NEGATIVE ALARM CONDITION._

## 6.1.2 * Determination of ALARM CONDITIONS and assignment of priority

For each HAZARDOUS SITUATION where the MANUFACTURER has chosen to use an ALARM SYSTEM as a means of RISK CONTROL, the MANUFACTURER shall assign an ALARM CONDITION and its priority using Table 1.

For HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS where the onset of potential HARM is delayed and the potential result of a failure to respond is discomfort or minor reversible injury, the MANUFACTURER may determine that no ALARM CONDITION is required. In such cases, the MANUFACTURER may implement an INFORMATION SIGNAL.
