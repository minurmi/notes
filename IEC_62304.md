## B.4.2 RISK MANAGEMENT

The end of the software ARCHITECTURE ACTIVITY is the earliest point in the development when the full set of SOFTWARE ITEMS is defined and the RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY has identified how the SOFTWARE ITEMS relate to SAFETY. This is therefore the earliest point at which SOFTWARE ITEMS can be classified definitively according to their SAFETY role.
This point corresponds to the point where RISK CONTROL is begun in ISO 14971.

Before this point, the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS identifies ARCHITECTURAL RISK CONTROL measures, for example adding protective subsystems, or reducing the opportunities for software failures to cause HARM. After this point, the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS uses PROCESSES aimed at reducing the probability of failure of SOFTWARE ITEMS. In other words, the classification of a SOFTWARE ITEM specifies PROCESS-based RISK CONTROL measures to be applied to that item.

It is expected that MANUFACTURERS will find it useful to classify software before this point, for example to focus attention on areas to be investigated, but such classification should be regarded as preliminary and should not be used to justify the omission of PROCESSES.

As the design evolves, new RISKS might become evident. Therefore, RISK MANAGEMENT should be applied as an integral part of the development PROCESS. This permits the development of an ARCHITECTURAL design that identifies a complete set of SOFTWARE ITEMS, including those that are required to function correctly to assure safe operation and those that prevent faults from causing HARM.

The software ARCHITECTURE should promote segregation of software items that are required for safe operation and should describe the methods used to ensure effective segregation of those SOFTWARE ITEMS.

# B.5 Software development PROCESS

## B.5.1 Software development planning

Planning is an iterative ACTIVITY that should be re-examined and updated as development progresses. The plan can evolve to incorporate more and better information as more is understood about the SYSTEM and the level of effort needed to develop the SYSTEM.

## B.5.2 Software requirements analysis

All software requirements should be identified in such a way as to make it possible to demonstrate TRACEABILITY between the requirement and SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing.

An area of frequent confusion is the distinction between customer needs, design inputs, software requirements, software functional specifications, and software design specifications. Design inputs are the interpretation of customer needs into formally documented MEDICAL DEVICE requirements. Software requirements are the formally documented specifications of what the software does to meet the customer needs and the design inputs. Software functional specifications are often included with the software requirements and define in detail what the software does to meet its requirements even though many different alternatives might also meet the requirements. Software design specifications define how the software will be designed and decomposed to implement its requirements and functional specifications.

The software requirements analysis ACTIVITY consists of analyzing the requirements allocated to software by the SYSTEM requirements PROCESS and deriving a comprehensive set of software requirements that reflect the allocated requirements.

The PROCESS of capture and analysis of SYSTEM and software requirements can be iterative.


## B.5.3 Software ARCHITECTURAL design

This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to define the major structural components of the software, their externally visible properties, and the relationship among them. If the behaviour of a component can affect other components, that behavior should be described in the software ARCHITECTURE. This description is especially important for behaviour that can affect components of the MEDICAL DEVICE that are outside the software. ARCHITECTURAL decisions are extremely important for implementing RISK CONTROL measures. Without understanding (and documenting) the behaviour of a component that can affect other components, it will be nearly impossible to show that the SYSTEM is safe. A software ARCHITECTURE is necessary to ensure the correct implementation of the software requirements. The software ARCHITECTURE is not complete unless all software requirements can be implemented by the identified SOFTWARE ITEMS. Because the design and implementation of the software is dependent on the ARCHITECTURE, the ARCHITECTURE is VERIFIED to complete this ACTIVITY. VERIFICATION of the ARCHITECTURE is generally done by technical EVALUATION.

# B.5.4 Software detailed design

This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to refine the SOFTWARE ITEMS and interfaces defined in the ARCHITECTURE to create SOFTWARE UNITS and their interfaces. Although SOFTWARE UNITS are often thought of as being a single function or module, this view is not always appropriate. We have defined SOFTWARE UNIT to be a SOFTWARE ITEM that is not subdivided into smaller items. SOFTWARE UNITS can be tested separately. The MANUFACTURER should define the level of detail of the SOFTWARE UNIT. Detailed design specifies algorithms, data representations, interfaces among different SOFTWARE UNITS, and interfaces between SOFTWARE UNITS and data structures. Detailed design must also be concerned with the packaging of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. It is necessary to document the design of each SOFTWARE UNIT and its interface so that the SOFTWARE UNIT can be implemented correctly. The detailed design fills in the details necessary to construct the software. It should be complete enough that the programmer is not required to make ad hoc design decisions.

A SOFTWARE ITEM can be decomposed so that only a few of the new SOFTWARE ITEMS implement the SAFETY-related requirement of the original SOFTWARE ITEM. The remaining SOFTWARE ITEMS do not implement SAFETY-related functions and can be reclassified into a lower software safety class. However, the decision to do this is in itself part of the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, and is documented in the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.


**IMPORTANT**
When present in the design, the MANUFACTURER should verify design characteristics which the MANUFACTURER believes are important for SAFETY. Examples of these characteristics include:
– implementation of the intended events, inputs, outputs, interfaces, logic flow, allocation of CPU, allocation of memory resources, error and exception definition, error and exception isolation, and error recovery;
– definition of the default state, in which all faults that can result in a hazardous situation are addressed, with events and transitions;
– initialization of variables, memory management; and
– cold and warm resets, standby, and other state changes that can affect the RISK CONTROL measures.

## B.5.5 SOFTWARE UNIT implementation and verification

This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to write and verify the code for the SOFTWARE UNITS.

## B.5.6 Software integration and integration testing

**Adrian T to read**

Software integration testing focuses on the transfer of data and control across a SOFTWARE ITEM’s internal and external interfaces. External interfaces are those with other software, including operating system software, and MEDICAL DEVICE hardware.

As applicable, integration testing demonstrates program behaviour at the boundaries of its input and output domains and confirms program responses to invalid, unexpected, and special inputs. The program’s actions are revealed when given combinations of inputs or unexpected sequences of inputs, or when defined timing requirements are violated. The test requirements in the plan should include, as appropriate, the types of white box testing to be performed as part of integration testing.

Software integration testing can be performed in a simulated environment, on actual target hardware, or on the full MEDICAL DEVICE.

## B.5.7 SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing

The organization of testing by types and test stage is flexible, but coverage of requirements, RISK CONTROL, usability, and test types (e.g., fault, installation, stress) should be demonstrated and documented.

## B.5.8 Software release

The MANUFACTURER should be able to show that the software that was developed using the development PROCESS is the software that is being released. The MANUFACTURER should also be able to retrieve the software and the tools used for its generation in case it is needed in the future and should store, package, and deliver the software in a manner that minimizes the software from being damaged or misused. Defined procedures should be established to ensure that these TASKS are performed appropriately and with consistent results.

# Relationship to other standards

MEDICAL DEVICE management standards such as ISO 13485 [7] (see C.2 and Annex D) and ISO 14971 (see Annex 0) provide a management environment that lays a foundation for an organization to develop products. Safety standards such as IEC 60601-1 [1] (see Annex C.4) and IEC 61010-1 [4] (see Annex C.5) give specific direction for creating safe MEDICAL DEVICES.

Many other standards such as ISO/IEC 12207 [9] (see Annex C.6), IEC 61508-3 [3] (see Annex C.7) and ISO/IEC 90003 [11] can be looked to as a source of methods, tools and techniques that can be used to implement the requirements in IEC 62304




# Software testing

## B.5.6 Software integration and integration testing
This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to plan and execute integration of SOFTWARE UNITS into aggregate SOFTWARE ITEMS as well as integration of SOFTWARE ITEMS into higher aggregated SOFTWARE ITEMS and to verify that the resulting SOFTWARE ITEMS behave as intended.

## B.5.7 SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing
This ACTIVITY requires the MANUFACTURER to verify the software’s functionality by verifying that the requirements for the software have been successfully implemented.
SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing demonstrates that the specified functionality exists. This testing VERIFIES the functionality and performance of the program as built with respect to the requirements for the software.


When a change is made to a SOFTWARE SYSTEM (even a small change), the degree of REGRESSION TESTING (not just the testing of the individual change) should be determined to ensure that no unintended side effects have been introduced. This REGRESSION TESTING (and the rationale for not fully repeating SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing) should be planned and documented.



The MANUFACTURER shall include or reference in the software development plan, a plan to integrate the SOFTWARE ITEMS (including SOUP) and perform testing during integration.

The MANUFACTURER shall test the integrated SOFTWARE ITEMS in accordance with the integration plan (see 5.1.5) and document the results. [Class B, C]

For software integration testing, the MANUFACTURER shall address whether the integrated SOFTWARE ITEM performs as intended.

When software items are integrated, the MANUFACTURER shall conduct REGRESSION TESTING appropriate to demonstrate that defects have not been introduced into previously integrated software. [Class B, C]

a) repeat tests, perform modified tests or perform additional tests, as appropriate, to verify the effectiveness of the change in correcting the problem;
b) conduct testing appropriate to demonstrate that unintended side effects have not been introduced; and
