## Subclause 4.2 – USABILITY ENGINEERING PROCESS for ME EQUIPMENT

As with the RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS before it, the existence of a generalized standard for USABILITY ENGINEERING eliminates the need for much, but not all, of the content in the second edition of IEC 60601-1-6. For example, IEC 62366 defines the USER as the “person using, i.e. operating or handling, the MEDICAL DEVICE”. This definition includes those who clean, maintain or install the MEDICAL DEVICE. In IEC 60601-1:2005, persons performing those functions are described as SERVICE PERSONNEL. This subclause bridges between the general PROCESS requirement in IEC 62366 and the specific application to ME EQUIPMENT.


## Clause 5 – Replacement of requirements given in IEC 62366

Clause 6 of IEC 62366:2007 specifies the general requirements for the material to be included in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENT, if such a document is provided. The ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENT is required to include a summary of the application specification (see 5.1 of IEC 62366). This replacement paragraph clarifies that for ME EQUIPMENT the summary is described in the same terms used in subclause 7.9.2.5 of IEC 60601-1:2005 to specify the ME EQUIPMENT description.
