# 201.12.4.4.104 *GAIN accuracy
The output at all possible GAIN settings shall be reproduced with a maximum amplitude error of ± 10 % compared to the test signal, referred to the input.

*Compliance is checked by the following test:*

*Apply a 5 Hz, 2 mV p-v sinusoidal signal to all ECG input channels. The output shall comply with the above requirement at each possible GAIN setting.*


# 201.12.4.4.101 *Linearity and dynamic range:

Digital AMBULATORY RECORDERS shall be capable of responding to and displaying input signal of 10 mV peak-to-valley (p-v) in amplitude (when set to the 5 mm/mV GAIN setting) and varying at a rate of 125 mV/s in the presence of a direct current (d.c.) offset voltage of ± 300 mV. The indicated time-varying output signal amplitude referred to input shall not change by more than 10 % or 50 mV, whichever is greater.

# Subclause 201.12.4.4.110 – Timing accuracy

The correlation of the occurrence time of an external event (for example, drug administration, presence of symptoms, physical activity) and the PATIENTs ECG complexes is essential to clinical interpretation. Since the recorded ECG is reviewed retrospectively, the recording ME EQUIPMENT and ME SYSTEM have to provide a mechanism for accurately indicating the actual occurrence time along with the ECG signals on both the display and printout.

The cumulative accuracy requirement of ± 30 s over 24 h ensures that the difference between the actual occurrence time and the recorded occurrence time is sufficiently small to allow clinical correlation and interpretation of the concomitant ECG complexes.

# Subclause 201.12.4.4.111 – GAIN settings and switching

Variations in the recorded amplitude of a PATIENTs ECG (due to physiological factors or LEAD placement) warrant the selection of different scale factors. A NOMINAL scaling factor of 10 mm/mV has been traditionally used. The additional GAIN settings of 5 mm/mV and 20 mm/mV conform to both IEC and AHA recommendations. Other GAIN settings (for example, 40 mm/mV and 2,5 mm/mV) may be provided at the option of the manufacturer. Continuous GAIN control is generally not desirable.

Inclusion of the ECG calibration pulse in the display provides the OPERATOR with a means of verification of the reproduced ECG amplitude
