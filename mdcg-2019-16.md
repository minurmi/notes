# Considerations
Make sure post-market surveillance plan includes:
- This includes monitoring and reacting to cybersecurity incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities including the ones used in SOUP components.
- Risk management has included cybersecurity risks arising both during intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse, and they have been mitigated considering usability. The software design and security has followed the state of the art and it is maintained through continuous QMS improvement, post-market surveillance and regular updates.
- The system is not intended to be used with other devices besides a personal computer. Minimum IT requirements have been defined for the PC to achieve the interoperability and security.
- The system security and interoperability is maintained by PulseOn as the system operator via continuous QMS improvement to maintain state of the art, and via post-market surveillance, which monitors the system incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities. Some of the service monitoring and reacting to the findings is subcontracted to the service provider Atostek. The gateway provider Treon is subcontracted to maintain the security of the gateway platform. Any fixes and patches are applied only via approval by PulseOn.
- The software performance and reliability during operation is maintained via post-market surveillance, which monitors the system incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities. The system is kept state of the art via continuous QMS improvement, including also SW development process, and regular system updates.
- The safe software design has been achieved by considering security during the whole lifecycle and following state of the art methods, also in post-market activities. This is reflected e.g. in the input requirements, adopted security solutions and used testing methods.

- Should we create PulseOn IT security policy including Security guidelines? (section 3.1. “Secure by design”)
- Should we recommend to enable the two-factor authentication in the user guide and limit the role or users to limit the access?

## Post-market

**3.8. Lifecycle Aspects**

During the support lifetime of the device, the manufacturer should put in place a process to gather
post-market information with respect to the security of the device (see also Chapter 6). This process
should take into account:
1. Security incidents directly related to medical device software
2. Security Vulnerabilities that are related to the medical device hardware/software and the 3rd
party hardware/software used with the medical device.
3. Changes in the threat landscape, including interoperability aspects

**5. Post-Market Surveillance and Vigilance**

The post-market phase of medical devices life cycle is a crucial aspect that manufacturers shall
implement as cybersecurity vulnerabilities change and evolve over time and controls implemented
during pre-market activities may be inadequate to maintain an acceptable benefit-risk level.
An effective and successful post-market cybersecurity surveillance program should include the
following aspects:
- operation of the device in the intended environment
- sharing and dissemination of cybersecurity information and knowledge of cybersecurity
vulnerabilities and threats across multiple sectors
- vulnerability remediation
- incident response

# 2. Basic Cybersecurity Concepts
## 2.1. IT Security, Information Security, Operation Security

[**IT Security:**](#13-cybersecurity-requirements-included-in-annex-i-of-the-medical-devices-regulations)
> Protection against a threat to the technical infrastructure of a cyber system which may lead to an alteration of its characteristics in order to carry out activities which were not intended by its owners, designers or users.
- Confidentiality of information at rest and in transit
- Integrity, which is necessary to ensure information authenticity and accuracy (i.e. non-repudiation)
- Availability of the processes, devices, data, and connected system

[**Operation Security:**](#13-cybersecurity-requirements-included-in-annex-i-of-the-medical-devices-regulations)
> Protection against the intended corruption of procedures or workflows which will have results that were unintended by its owners, designers or users.

[**Information Security:**](#13-cybersecurity-requirements-included-in-annex-i-of-the-medical-devices-regulations)
> Protection against the threat of theft, deletion or alteration of stored or transmitted data within a cyber system:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

## 2.2. Safety, Security and Effectiveness

Therefore, when assessing risks in accordance with Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulations, it is important to include security issues in the risk assessment, even in cases where security is not stated explicitly in the Regulations.

## 2.3. Intended use and intended operational environment of use

Manufacturers determine design inputs associated with cybersecurity requirements to ensure safety and effectiveness of products against cybersecurity risks and threats.
Expectations on the intended operating environment should be clearly documented and communicated to the operator.

## 2.4. Reasonably foreseeable misuse

Medical device manufacturers should ensure that a medical device is designed and manufactured in a way that ensures that the risks associated with reasonably foreseeable environmental conditions are removed or minimised. This may include the infield monitoring of the software’s vulnerabilities and the possibility to perform a device update (outside the context of a field safety corrective action) through, for example delivering patches to ensure the continued security of the device.

During the risk management process, the manufacturer should foresee or evaluate the potential exploitation of those vulnerabilities that may be a result of reasonably foreseeable misuse.

## 2.5. Operating Environment

Healthcare providers should adopt a risk management process adhering to **general cybersecurity best practices:**
- Good physical security to prevent unauthorised physical access to medical device or network access points;
- Access control measures (e.g. role based) to ensure only authenticated and authorised personnel are allowed access to network elements, stored information, services and applications;
- Network access controls, such as segmentation, to limit medical device communication;
- General patch management practices that ensure timely security patch updates;
- Malware protection to prevent unauthorised code execution;
- Security awareness training.
- Auditability that supports non-repudiation, i.e. the ability to reliability determine who made what changes to the system and when to assist with forensics

## 2.6. Joint Responsibility - Specific expectations from other stakeholders

Agreements contemplating responsibility are one option to ensure that all parties understand the joint responsibility of managing devices in a medical IT-network.
Modification of a medical device, e.g. the installation or enabling of third-party software including software patching, should always be under explicit published guidance of the manufacturer.

### 2.6.1 Integrator

Atostek in our case.

The main responsibility of the integrator is the installation and configuration of the system and the integration into the operator’s environment. The integrator should ensure that the system is configured in such a way that it can operate securely in the health and medical service target environment.

### 2.6.2 Operator

Hospital IT + PulseOn + Atostek.

The operator is responsible for the procurement and should ensure that security is maintained during the operation and application of the system (medical device), and particularly not compromised by changes in the environment of by user interaction.

### 2.6.3. Users including healthcare & medical professionals, patients & consumers

Instruction for Use should include the necessary information so that patients and consumers can be up-to-date with the latest  version of software, protect the device throughout its lifespan, use sufficiently complex passwords, turn off features that are not used, secure the computer or tablet devices, use backups and protection of their healthcare data.

# 3. Secure Design and Manufacture

Security aapects need to be considered by the manufacturers from an early stage of development and manufacturing process and throughout the entire life cycle.

## 3.1. “Secure by design”

1. **Security management**: security-related activities are adequately planned, documented and executed throughout the
product’s lifecycle
2. **Specification of security requirements**: identify the security capabilities that are required for appropriate protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, function and services of the medical device along with the specified product security contex
3. Secure by design: including defence in depth
4. Secure implementation
5. Security verification and validation testing: ensure that all the security requirements have been met for the product and that security of the product is maintained when the product is used as intended.
6. Management of security-related issues of a product
7. Security update management: security updates and security patches associated with the product are tested for regressions
8. Security guidelines: user documentation that describes how to integrate, configure, and maintain the defence in depth strategy

## 3.2. Security Risk Management

A product risk analysis for safety should therefore consider the effects of security vulnerabilities to the essential functioning of the product.

1. Risk management plan
