# PulseOn SW development process – Target

1. Consult customer and relevant stakeholders
2. Define project goal
3. Identify releases based on goal
    1. Break features down to different stages, i.e. epics
    2. Identify the dependencies (also hardware) and critical path of the epics
    3. Group epics into releases
    4. Device an outline for the release schedule consulting stakeholders
4. Work on releases
    1. Work in iterations implementing epic contents
    2. Test implemented work continuously
    3. Revise priority order and the content of epics based on progress and stakeholder feedback
    4. Release test versions
6. Iterate planning and implementing stages
7. Project goal reached



# PulseOn SW development process – Reality

1. Vaguely discuss project goals with colleagues and customer
2. Come up with an incomplete list of features to reach project goal
3. Arbitrarily set project schedule based on discussions
    1. Schedule releases based on what "looks good"
    2. Do not identify dependencies or consult experts
4. Work on releases
   1. Come up with a list of tasks requred for the release on the fly
   2. Take the most urgent taks to be worked on from backlog. May change from day-to-day.
   3. Sometimes leave work untested because of schedule pressures
   4. Very rarely release test versions
5. Do not iterate planning and implementing stages in a meaningful fashion
   1. Arbitrarily change release contents and current tasks based on urget needs that were not considered when identifying project goals
   2. Do not update overall project schedule
6. Mismatch between project plan and actual development
7. Project goal not reached
