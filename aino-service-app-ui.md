- What data is shown in the Aino web service to the doctors and nurses?
    + How is the data presented? As a static/interactive graph, numerical summary etc.?
    + graph: SR, tag, no data, symptoms (30 beat / 5 min periods)
    + summary:
        * measurement length
        * percentage of beat type per 30 beat periods (or 5 min?)
    + nice to have: beat-to-beat interval / HR view for 5 min period?
    + Patient device status
        * connected/not connected
        * notifications enabled/disabled
- Should the patients have a login to the web service? NO
    + What data would be shown to them?
    + Zenicor study feedback: patients wished for a data UI
- What is shown in the mobile app to the patients?
    + Device battery charge?
    + Alert if connection to the device/cloud is lost
    + Hidden menu for the nurse
        * Connection state to the device?
        * Connection state to the cloud?
- Memory runs out:
    + Alert patient
    + Alert nurse
    + Stop recording
