Jira is evaluated as a tool to manage and split DIRs for smaller tasks
SW workshop held to analyze the current architecture and priorities the areas for medical development
Mechanics and Electronics documentation creation and reviewing against Medical Process requirements.
Magnetic holding studies for docking – stronger magnets ordered for testing to keep the connection highly reliable between dock and device.
Mechanics and Electronics documentation creation and reviewing against Medical Process requirements.

 Aino project status
Jira is evaluated as a tool to manage and split DIRs for smaller tasks
HW development plan in being prepared
Encoding/data storage improvements are integrated
Aino 2 demo software bugs are fixed and it is used as the basis for medical development
32kHz clock source for AFE change: Macroboards modified and design for actual boards started.
Mechanics and Electronics documentation creation and reviewing against Medical Process requirements.

First project meeting held to ensure that the key documents are understood by everyone
Next steps for teams are to break down DIRs for smaller tasks and prepare development plans
Project steering meetings will be held together with the management team meeting

Aino 2 demo software bug fixing continues.

Encoding/data storage improvements in testing
Marcoboards modification started. Target to test and approve tiny further update for the actual desing (power optimization change – and less sw work change)
Medical process coordination for Aino electronics  & Mechanics

Aino project status
All teams have started regulated R&D process
Project meeting next week to agree on the next project steps
Integration work done for Aino 2 demo software. Some bugs still remain to be fixed.

Encoding/data storage improvements in testing
Macroboards test ongoing – 11 pcs passed and 1 faled.


Aino project documentation status
Aino concept formally approved
Project plan formally approved
DIRs formally approved
=> In accordance with the Milestone M0 review decision; we have now formally moved to regulated development stage of Aino =>
Development work shall be planned in a documented manner, design results shall be documented & approved formally in a preplanned manner
We have to start using change management procedure to authorize changes to approved product concept, DIRs & design solutions
Risk management will start in full
Integration work continues for Aino 2 demo software
Encoding/data storage improvements ongoing
Macroboards assembled – AOI in the process now – if ok boards should be received early next week. (AOI = Advanced Optical Inspection).
Some fine tuning for the actual board design.
Mechanics assembly coordination with Kyrel
